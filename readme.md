# Last Delivery

## Genre
Top-down pixel adventure / puzzle game

## Storyline:

You are PX-42, the last functioning postal robot in a tiny town long abandoned by humans. One day, you receive a mysterious final letter in your internal queue, addressed simply to “Her”, with no further details. Driven by your programming and a hint of curiosity, you set off across the quiet town to figure out who "“"Her" is and deliver the last letter before your battery runs out forever.

## Gameplay:
- Simple WASD or arrow movement.
- Interact with objects/NPCs by walking into them or pressing space.
- Small "puzzle" elements like opening gates, or navigating around blocked paths.
- Find clues in mailboxes, old letters, and broken robots to uncover the identity of "Her".

What makes it charming:
- Mini-narratives from other robots or abandoned tech.
- A slow reveal of who “Her” is and what the letter means.
- Emotionally satisfying ending with a soft fade-out.

Dev Simplicity:
- Top-down tile-based movement (easy to implement).
- Small world (maybe 5–7 connected screens/areas).
- Pixel art style or minimal flat style to speed up asset creation.
