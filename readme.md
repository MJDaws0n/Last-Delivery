📖 Storyline:

You are PX-42, the last functioning postal robot in a tiny town long abandoned by humans. One day, you receive a mysterious final letter in your internal queue, addressed simply to “Her”, with no further details. Driven by your programming and a hint of curiosity, you set off across the quiet town to figure out who “Her” is and deliver the last letter before your battery runs out forever. ⚡💌
